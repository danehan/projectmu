Welcome to Project μ! This is an experimental community of microhouses for homeless in Evansville. Our goal is to help decrease poverty by giving a hand-up instead of a handout. Giving the homeless stable housing while going through career training and job mentorship from programs like the Evansville Christian Life Center’s Gain Initiative. The idea is to create small, modular, energy-efficient “microhouses” whose infrastructure can be easily built and replicated, all while making each unique through the exterior and interior design of the house. The ultimate goal of this project is a proof of concept for not only usable for Evansville, IN but also the world. During this project, we will be releasing documentation on how the units were constructed as well as a bill of materials and potential software. Open-sourcing the project to the community so people can contribute and expand the catalogue of knowledge allowing for increased power efficiency, cost reduction, and better self-sufficiency.
